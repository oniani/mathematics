We do interaction effects if we think that there are relationships between
regressor variables.

ONE DOES NOT NEED TO CENTER CATEGORICAL VARIABLES.
ONLY CENTER CONTINUOUS VARIABLES!!
CENTERING AROUND THE MEAN REMOVES THE COLLINEARITY.

CENTERING A VARIABLE IS ONLY GOOD WHEN YOU EITHER DO INTERACTION EFFECTS
OR SQUARE A VARIABLE.

df$x1.c = df$x1 - mean(df$x1)
df$x2.c = df$x2 - mean(df$x2)

df$x1.v.x2 = df$x1.c * df$x2.c

lm (y ~ x1.c + x2.c + x1.v.x2
lm (y ~ x1.c * x2.c)
lm (y ~ x1.c + x2.c + x1.c : x2.c)

All these three are equivalent for centering around the mean and doing
interaction effects. BUT, IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE, WE ARE NOT USING THE CREATED
COLUMN x1.v.x2.

When one has a lot of variables, a good approach is

Y ~ (x1.c + x2.c + ... + xk.c)^2

This syntax DOES NOT center the variables.
So, one will first have to center them like shown below.

df$x1.c = df$x1 - mean(df$x1)
df$x2.c = df$x2 - mean(df$x2)
