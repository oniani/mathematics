\begin{itemize}
    \item[4.4.1]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)]
                \textbf{Per Theorem 4.3.4}, we know that products of continuous
                functions are continuous. Hence, it suffices to show that the
                function $g(x) = x$ is continuous on all of $\reals$. Now, let
                $\epsilon < 0$ be given and choose $\delta = \epsilon$.  Then,
                we have that $\forall x, y \in \reals, \abs{x - y} < \delta$.
                It follows that $\abs{g(x) - g(y)} = \abs{x - y} < \epsilon$.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(b)]
                Let $x_n = n$ and $y_n = n - \dfrac{1}{n}$. Then $\abs{x_n -
                y_n} \to 0$, but $\abs{f(x_n) - f(y_n)} = 3n - \dfrac{1}{n(3 -
                \frac{1}{n^2})} \to \infty$. Hence, \textbf{by Theorem 4.4.5},
                the function $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $\reals$.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(c)]
                Let $A \subset \reals$ be any bounded subset. Then
                $\overline{A}$, the closure of $A$ in $\reals$, is compact.
                \textbf{By Theorem 4.4.8}, $f$ is uniformly continuous on
                $\overline{A}$, and hence on any subset of $\overline{A}$. In
                particular, $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$.\\
                $\qed$
        \end{itemize}

    \newpage

    \item[4.4.6]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)]
                Such request is possible.\\
                Let $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$ for $x \in (0, 1)$. Then it follows
                that $f$ is continuous on $(0, 1)$. Now, let $x_n =
                \dfrac{1}{n}$.  Then $x_n$ is Cauchy. However, $f(x_n) = n$ and
                thus, $(f(x_n))$ is not Cauchy.

            \item[(b)]
                Such request is impossible.\\
                Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ is a uniformly
                continuous function on $(0, 1)$ and $x_n$ is the Cauchy sequence.
                Now, if $f(x_n)$ is not Cauchy, then $\exists \epsilon_0$ s.t.
                $\forall N \in \nats, f\abs{(x_n) - f(y_n)} \geq \epsilon_0$
                for all $m, n \geq N$. Finally, since $\abs{x_n - y_n} \to 0$
                we face a contradiction as we assumed that $f$ is uniformly
                continuous. Thus, such request is impossible.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(c)]
                Such request is impossible.\\
                If $(x_n) \to x$, then $[0, \infty)$ is closed and containts
                $x$. Finally, since $f$ is continuous on $x$, by the definition
                of continuity, we get $(x_n) \to x$ and it follows that
                $f(x_n) \to f(x)$. Thus, such request is impossible.\\
                $\qed$
        \end{itemize}

    \item[4.4.11]
        We will first prove the statement directly and then prove its converse.
        \\
        \\
        Let us suppose that $g$ is continuous on $O$. Let $c \in g^{-1}(O)$.
        Then $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. if $x \in V_\delta(c)$,
        it follows that $g(x) \in V_\delta(g(c))$. Choose $\epsilon$ s.t.
        $V_\epsilon(g(c)) \subseteq O$. Then $x \in V_\delta(c)$ implies that
        $g(x) \in V_\epsilon(g(c)) \subseteq O$ and thus, $x \in g^{-1}(O)$.
        Finally, we get $V_\delta(c) \subseteq g^{-1}(O)$ and $g^{-1}(O)$ is
        open.\\
        $\qed$
        \\
        \\
        Conversely, suppose that for every open $O \subseteq \reals$,
        $g^{-1}(O)$ is an open set. Let $O = V_\epsilon(g(c))$. Then
        $g^{-1}(O)$ is open. Now, since $c \in g^{-1}(O)$ and $c$ is an
        interior point, $\exists \delta > 0$ s.t $V_\delta(c) \subseteq
        g^{-1}(O)$. Then, by definition, if $x \in V_\delta(c)$, it follows
        that $g(x) \in O = V_\epsilon(g(c))$ which shows that $g$ is a
        continuous function.\\
        $\qed$
        \\
        Finally, we have proven both the direct statement and its converse and
        hence, $g$ is continuous if and only if $g^{-1}(O)$ is open whenever $O
        \subseteq \reals$ is an open set.\\
        $\qed$

    \item[4.5.7]
        We have $\forall 0 \leq x \leq 1$, we have $0 \leq f(x) \leq 1$.
        Consider a function $g : [0, 1] \to \reals$, given by $g(x) = f(x) -
        x$.  Then $g$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$. Now $g(0) = f(0) \geq 0$, but
        $g(1) = f(1) - 1 \leq 0$. Hence, \textbf{by the Intermediate Value
        Theorem (Theorem 4.5.1)}, $\exists x_0 \in [0, 1]$ s.t.  $g(x_0) = 0$.
        Hence, we have that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\\
        $\qed$
