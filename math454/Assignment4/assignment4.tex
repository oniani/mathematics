\begin{itemize}
    \item[2.6.2]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)]
                Such sequence exists. $a_n = \dfrac{(-1)^n}{n}$ is a Cauchy
                sequence that is not monotone since it alternates, but
                converges to $0$.

            \item[(b)]
                Per \textbf{Lemma 2.6.3}, such sequence cannot exist.

            \item[(c)]
                Such sequences cannot exist. A divergent monotone sequence
                implies that the sequence is unbounded. Unbounded and monotone
                sequence, on the other hand, cannot contain a convergent
                subsequence. Hence, by \textbf{Cauchy Criterion (Theorem
                2.6.4)}, it cannot contain a Cauchy subsequence.

            \item[(d)]
                Such sequence exists. Let us define
                \begin{equation*}
                    a_n =
                    \begin{cases}
                        n \text{ if } n \in \nats \text{ is odd}\\
                        0 \text{ if } n \in \nats \text{ is even}
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation*}
                Then it is easy to see that sequence is unbounded since
                $\forall k \in \nats, a_{2k + 1} = 2k + 1 > k$. On the other
                hand the subsequence formed by the even-termed elements is
                comprised of only zeros and hence, converges to $0$. Therefore,
                the subsequence is Cauchy. Hence, we found an unbounded
                sequence containing a subsequence that is Cauchy.
        \end{itemize}

    \item[2.6.3]
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[(a)]
                Since $x_n$ and $y_n$ are both Cauchy sequences, $\forall
                \epsilon > 0, \exists N_1, N_2 \in \nats$ s.t. $\abs{x_{m_1} -
                x_{n_1}} < \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $\abs{y_{m_2} - y_{n_2}} <
                \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$ with $m_1, n_1 \geq N_1$ and $m_2, n_2
                \geq N_2$. Then let $N = \max{\{N_1, N_2\}}$. It follows that
                $\forall m, n \geq N, \abs{x_m - x_n} < \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$
                and $\abs{y_m - y_n} < \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$. Finally, using the
                triangle inequality, we get:
                \begin{align*}
                    \abs{(x_m + y_m) - (x_n + y_n)} &=
                    \abs{(x_m - x_n) - (y_m - y_n)}\\
                    &\leq \abs{x_m - x_n} + \abs{y_m - y_n}\\
                    &< \dfrac{\epsilon}{2} + \dfrac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
                \end{align*}
                Thus, we conclude that $(x_n + y_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(b)]
                Since $x_n$ and $y_n$ are both Cauchy sequence, they are also
                bounded and hence, $\exists X, Y$ s.t  $\forall n \in \nats,
                \abs{x_n} < X$ and $\abs{y_n} < Y$. Additionally, $\forall
                \epsilon > 0, \exists N_1, N_2 \in \nats$ s.t. $\abs{x_{m_1} -
                x_{n_1}} < \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $\abs{y_{m_2} - y_{n_2}} <
                \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$ with $m_1, n_1 \geq N_1$ and $m_2, n_2
                \geq N_2$. Then let $N = \max{\{N_1, N_2\}}$. We get:
                \begin{align*}
                    \abs{x_my_m - x_ny_n} &=
                    \abs{x_m(y_m - y_n) + y_n(x_m - x_n)}\\
                    &\leq \abs{x_m}\abs{y_m - y_n} +
                    \abs{y_n}\abs{x_m - x_n}\\
                    &< \dfrac{A\epsilon}{2} + \dfrac{A\epsilon}{2} =
                    \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}AB.
                \end{align*}
                Thus, we found $\epsilon^{\prime} = \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}AB > 0$
                with $N$ s.t. $m, n \geq N$ and $\abs{x_m, y_m - x_ny_n} <
                \epsilon^\prime$.  Hence, we conclude that $(x_ny_n)$ is a
                Cauchy sequence.\\
                $\qed$
        \end{enumerate}

    \item[2.7.5]
        We have to prove that the series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty 1/n^p$ converges
        if and only if $p > 1$. By \textbf{Cauchy Condensation Test}, the
        series converges if and only if $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty
        \dfrac{2^n}{2^{np}} = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty 2^{n(1 - p)}$ converges. Now,
        we need to get $2^{n(1 - p)}$ less than $1$ as otherwise, the sequence
        will diverge (all terms will be defferent and $\geq 1$). $2^{n(1 - p)}
        < 1$ if and only if $n(1 - p) < 0$. Since $n \in \nats$, we can safely
        divide both sides of the inequality by $n$. We get $1 - p < 0$ and
        thus, $p > 1$.  Hence, we have proven that the series $\sum_{n =
        1}^\infty 1/n^p$ converges if and only if $p > 1$.
        \\\\
        \textit{NOTE: We did not take the classic ``prove it directly and prove
        its converse'' approach since every statement used in the proof was if
        and only if statement. \textbf{Cauchy Condensation Test} is if and only
        if and $2^{n(1 - p)} < 1$ when $n(1 - p) < 0$ is if and only if}.

    \item[2.7.8]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)]
                True. By \textbf{Theorem 2.7.3}, $\sum{a_n}$ converges
                absolutely. It follows that $\lim{a_n} = 0$. Thus, $\abs{a_n}$
                is bounded and $\exists B > 0$ s.t. $\forall n \in \nats,
                \abs{a_n} \leq B$. Now, by \textbf{Algebraic Limit Theorem for
                Series (Theorem 2.7.1)}, $\sum{B\abs{a_n}}$ and $B\abs{a_n}
                \geq a^2_n$. Finally, per \textbf{Comparison Test (Theorem
                2.7.4)}, $\sum{a^2_n}$ converges.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(b)]
                False. Let $a_n = b_n = \dfrac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n}}$. Now,
                $\lim{b_n} = 0$ and thus, $(b_n)$ converges. Additionally,
                $\lim{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}}} = 0$ and $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ is
                decreasing. Hence, by \textbf{Alternating Series Test (Theorem
                2.7.7)}, we get that $\sum{a_n}$ converges. Thus, both
                $\sum{a_n}$ and $\lim{(b_n)}$ converge. However, $a_nb_n =
                \dfrac{1}{n}$ which is harmonic series and it does not
                converge.

            \item[(c)]
                True. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\sum{a_n}$
                converges conditionally and $\sum{n^2a_n}$ converges. Then,
                $\lim{n^2a_n} = 0$ and $\exists N$ s.t. $\forall n \geq N,
                \abs{n^2a_n} < 1$. We then get $\abs{a_n} < \dfrac{1}{n^2}$.
                Now, per \textbf{Comparison Test (Theorem 2.7.4)}, $\sum{a_n}$
                converges absolutely and we face the contradiction since
                $\sum{a_n}$ converges conditionally. Thus, $\sum{a_n}$
                converges conditionally, then $\sum{n^2a_n}$ diverges.\\
                $\qed$
        \end{itemize}

    \item[2.7.9]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)]
                Suppose $r < r^\prime < 1$. Since $\lim_{n \to
                \infty}\abs{\dfrac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}} = r < 1$, let $\epsilon =
                r^\prime - r > 0$. Then $\exists N \in \nats$ s.t. $\forall n
                \geq \nats$, the following is true:
                \begin{align*}
                    &\abs{\abs{\dfrac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}} - r} < \epsilon\\
                    &\abs{\dfrac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}} < r + \epsilon\\
                    &\abs{\dfrac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}} < r + r^\prime - r\\
                    &\abs{\dfrac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}} < r^\prime\\
                    &\abs{a_{n + 1}} \leq \abs{{a_n}}r^\prime
                \end{align*}
                $\qed$

            \item[(b)]
                Since $\abs{r^\prime} < 1$, $\sum(r^\prime)^n$ is a convergent
                geometric series. Then, by \textbf{Algebraic Limit Theorem for
                Series (Theorem 2.7.1)}, $\abs{a_N}\sum{(r^\prime)^n}$.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(c)]
                Notice that $\sum{\abs{a_n}} = \sum_{n = 1}^N \abs{a_n}  +
                \sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty\abs{a_n}$. Now, it is easy to see that
                $N\sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty a_n$ converges by \textbf{Comparison
                Test (Theorem 2.7.4)} since $N\sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty \leq
                \abs{a_N}\sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty {r^\prime}^{n - N}$ (the fact
                that $\abs{a_N}\sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty {r^\prime}^{n - N}$
                converges was proved in part (b) of this exercise). Hence,
                $\sum{a_n}$ converges as well. Finally, as $\sum{\abs{a_n}}$
                converges absolutely, by \textbf{Absolute Convergence Test
                (Theorem 2.7.6)}, $\sum{a_n}$ conveges absolutely as well.\\
                $\qed$
