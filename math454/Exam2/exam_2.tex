    \item[2.]
        Let us first prove that
        $\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C} + \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C} = [0, 1]$.
        Recall that the Cantor set $\mathbb{C}$ is the set of all numbers in
        $[0, 1]$ that in the \textbf{ternary system} can be represented as the
        sequence of $0$s and $2$s only. Then $\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C}$ must only
        contain $0$s and $1$s. Now, let $r \in [0, 1]$. If we show that $\exists
        x, y \in \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C}$ s.t $x + y \in [0, 1]$, then we have
        effectively shown that
        $\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C} + \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C} = [0, 1]$. Let us
        construct $x$ and $y$ in the following manner:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[*]
                Let $x$ have $0$s in the same places where it is in $r$ and let
                $x$ have $1$s when the corresponding digit in $r$ is either $1$
                or $2$.

            \item[*]
                Let $y$ have $0$s in the same places where $r$ has $0s$ or
                $1$s. Let $y$ have $1$s when the corresponding digit in $r$ is
                $2$.
        \end{itemize}
        Hence, we split all $2$s in $r$ in a way that half goes to $x$ and half
        goes to $y$, and all $1$s of $r$ were given to $x$. Thus, $x + y = r$.
        For instance, if $r = 0.120120\dots$, then $x = 0.110110\dots$ and $y =
        0.010010\dots$. It follows that $x + y = 0.120120\dots = r$. Now, since
        we have already shown that
        $\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C} + \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{C} = [0, 1]$, we can just
        multiply both sides of the equation by $2$ and we get
        $\mathbb{C} + \mathbb{C} = [0, 2]$.\\

            \item[(a)]
                According to \textbf{Definition 4.2.1 (Functional Limit)},
                we have to show that $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$
                s.t. $0 < \abs{x - 3} < \delta \implies \abs{x^2 - 5x + 4 -
                (-2)} < \epsilon$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Let
                $\delta = -0.5 + \sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}}$
                ($\delta > 0$ since $\sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}} > 0.5$).
                Then suppose that $\abs{x - 3} = \abs{x - 3} < -0.5 +
                \sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}}$
                Notice that:
                \begin{align*}
                    \abs{x^2 - 5x + 4 - (-2)} &= \absb{x^2 - 5x + 6}\\
                                              &= \absb{(x - 2)(x - 3)}\\
                                              &= \absb{-0.5 + \sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}} + 1} \times \absb{-0.5 + \sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}}}\\
                                              &< \absb{\sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}} + 0.5} \times \absb{\sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}} - 0.5}\\
                                              &= \absb{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - 0.25}\\
                                              &= \absb{\frac{\epsilon}{2}} = \frac{\epsilon}{2} < \epsilon
                \end{align*}
                Hence, we showed that $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta =
                -0.5 + \sqrt{0.25 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}}$ s.t.
                $0 < \abs{x - 3} < \delta \implies \abs{x^2 - 5x + 4 - (-2)} <
                \epsilon$.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(b)]
                Per \textbf{Exercise 4.2.9 (b)} that I have completed as a part
                of the assignment, we can say $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L$ if
                $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists M > 0$ s.t. if $x > M$ we have
                $\abs{f(x) - L} < \epsilon$. Let us now show that $\lim_{x \to
                \infty} \dfrac{2x}{x + 4} = 2$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given and
                let $M = \dfrac{8}{\epsilon}$. Then if $x > M$, we have
                $x > \dfrac{8}{\epsilon}$. We have
                $\dfrac{2x}{x + 4} =
                \abs{\dfrac{2 \frac{8}{\epsilon}}{\frac{8}{\epsilon} + 4}  - 2}
                = \dfrac{8}{\frac{8}{\epsilon} + 4} =
                \dfrac{2\epsilon}{\epsilon + 2} =
                \epsilon - \dfrac{4}{\epsilon + 2} < \epsilon$.\\
                Hence, $\lim_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{2x}{x + 4} = 2$.\\
                $\qed$
        \end{itemize}

    \item[5.]
        We need to prove that $\forall c \in [0, \infty)$ and
        $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. whenever
        $\abs{x - c} < \delta$ (with $x \in [0, \infty)$), it follows that
        $\abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{c}} < \epsilon$.
        Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Now, let us consider the following two
        cases:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(1)]
                $c = 0$\\
                If $c = 0$, let $\delta = \epsilon^4$. Then
                $\abs{x - c} = \abs{x - 0} = \abs{x} < \epsilon^4$.
                Now,
                $\abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{0}} = \abs{\sqrt[4]{x}} < \epsilon$
                is true as if we raise both sides of the inequality to the
                power of four, we get $\abs{x} < \epsilon^4$ which is true.
                Hence, we have that $\abs{x - c} < \delta$ implies
                $\abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{c}} < \epsilon$.\\
                $\qed$

            \item[(2)]
                $c > 0$\\
                If $c > 0$, let $\delta = \epsilon\sqrt[4]{c}$. Then
                $\abs{x - c} < \epsilon\sqrt[4]{c}$.
                Consider $\abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{c}}$. Now, notice that:
                \begin{align*}
                    \abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{c}} &= \abs{\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{c} \times \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[4]{x} + \sqrt[4]{c}}}\\
                                                    &= \abs{\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{c}} \times \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[4]{x} + \sqrt[4]{c}}\\
                                                    &= \abs{x - c} \times \dfrac{1}{(\sqrt[4]{x} + \sqrt[4]{c})(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{c})}\\
                                                    &< \dfrac{\abs{x - c}}{\sqrt[4]{c^3}}\\
                                                    &\leq \dfrac{\abs{x - c}}{\sqrt[4]{c}}\\
                                                    &< \dfrac{\epsilon\sqrt[4]{c}}{\sqrt[4]{c}} = \epsilon
                \end{align*}
                Hence, we have that $\abs{x - c} < \delta$ implies
                $\abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{c}} < \epsilon$.\\
                $\qed$
        \end{itemize}

        Thus, we have now shown that $\forall c \in [0, \infty)$ and
        $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. whenever
        $\abs{x - c} < \delta$ (with $x \in [0, \infty)$), it follows that
        $\abs{\sqrt[4]{x} - \sqrt[4]{c}} < \epsilon$.\\
        $\qed$

        Note that function $f : \reals \to \reals$ would not be well-defined if
        repeating $9$s were allowed. If repeating $9$s are allowed, then the
        decimal expansion of the number is not unique since $1 = 0.9999...$ and
        the function $f : \reals \to \reals$ is not well-defined. Hence, we do
        not allow for repeating $9$s.

    \item[7.]
        Let us first prove that $f(x) = 1/x^2$ is uniformly continuous on
        $[0, \infty)$. Let $x, y \in [1, \infty)$ and let $\epsilon > 0$ be
        set. Then we have:
        \begin{align*}
            \absb{\dfrac{1}{x^2} - \dfrac{1}{y^2}} &= \absb{\dfrac{y^2 - x^2}{x^2y^2}}\\
                                                   &= \absb{\dfrac{(x + y)(x - y)}{x^2y^2}}\\
                                                   &= \dfrac{x + y}{x^2y^2}\abs{x - y}
        \end{align*}
        Since $x, y \in [1, \infty)$, it follows that
        $\dfrac{x + y}{x^2y^2} \leq 2$ and for $x, y \in [1, \infty)$, we have:
        \begin{equation*}
            \absb{\dfrac{1}{x^2} - \dfrac{1}{y^2}} \leq 2\abs{x - y}
        \end{equation*}
        Now, let $\delta = \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$. Then we have
        $\abs{x - y} < \delta$ and it follows that
        $\absb{\dfrac{1}{x^2} - \dfrac{1}{y^2}} < \epsilon$. Hence, by
        \textbf{Definition 4.4.4 (Uniform Continuity)}, $f(x) = 1/x^2$ is
        uniformly continuous on $[0, \infty)$.\\
        $\qed$
        \\
        \\
        Let us now prove that $f(x) = 1/x^2$ is not uniformly continuous on the
        interval $(0, 1]$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f(x)$
        is uniformly continuous on $(0, 1]$. Then for $\epsilon > 0$ there must
        exist $\delta  > 0$ s.t. $\forall x, y \in (0, 1]$ with
        $\abs{x - y} < \delta$, it follows that $\abs{f(x) - f(y)} < \epsilon$.
        Now, let $x = \dfrac{2}{n}$ and $y = \dfrac{1}{n}$ with $n \geq 2$. We
        have that $\abs{x - y}$ implies
        \begin{equation*}
            \absb{\dfrac{1}{x^2} - \dfrac{1}{y^2}} = \absb{\dfrac{\frac{3}{n^2}}{\frac{4}{n^2}}} = \dfrac{3}{4} < \epsilon
        \end{equation*}
        Now, we got that $\epsilon > \dfrac{3}{4}$, however, $\abs{f(x) - f(y)}
        < \epsilon$ must be true $\forall \epsilon > 0$. Hence, we face a contradiction
        and $f(x) = 1/x^2$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0, 1]$.\\
        $\qed$
        \\
        \\
        Finally, we have shown that $f(x) = 1/x^2$ is uniformly continuous on
        $[0, \infty)$, but not on $(0, 1]$.\\
        $\qed$
