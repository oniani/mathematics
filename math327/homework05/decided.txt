You take 25% of the data and 75% of the data and make the line go through it.

Why square root of the absolute residuals?

hist (rnorm (1000)) gets a normal histogram.
What if we take absolute values of normal variables.
What happens is that the bell curve is folded to the left resulting in a
right-skewed distribution.

hist(sqrt(abs(rnorm(1000))))
