# Residual Plots

William S. Gosset invented a t-test but his pseudonim was student as he could not put
his real name on the paper (due to patent issues).

$d_i = \dfrac{e_i}{\hat\sigma}$

## Studentized Residuals

Review these pages:
  * Page 130 (the normal probability plot)
  * Page 132 (figure 4.3 ~ different stylezed residual plots with common issues, violations of assumptions)

## Some code

load (file.choose())
lm1 = lm (y ~ x1, data=dataB.5)
plot (lm1)

If outlier is not obvious, then it is not an outlier (this is a recommendation
from an applied statistician ~ Dr. Phil).
