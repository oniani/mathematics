A subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ is called a $P_3$\textbf{-set} if there exists (not necessarily distinct) elements
$x, y, z \in S$ such that $x + y + z$ is prime.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Give some examples of $P_3$-sets.
\begin{quote}
$\{1\}$ because 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 is a prime.\\
$\{2, 3\}$ because 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 is a prime.\\
$\{12, 25, 30\}$ because 12 + 25 + 30 = 67 is a prime.
\end{quote}

\item[(b)]
Prove or Disprove: If $A$ is a $P_3$-set, and $A \subseteq B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^+$, then $B$ is a $P_3$-set.
\begin{quote}
It's right so let's prove it.
Since we know that $A$ is a $P_3$-set, we know there exist elements (not necessarily distinct) $x,y$ and $z$ such that
$x + y + z$ is prime.\ Since $A \subseteq B$, we know that all elements of $A$ are also in $B$ meaning that $x,y$ and $z$
are in $B$ as well. Then there exist elements $x,y,z \in B$ (which are also in $A$) such that $x + y + z$ is a prime.

\item[(c)]
Prove or Disprove: If $S$ is a $P_3$-set, then so is $S_{+3} := \{x + 3 \mid x \in S\}$.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample: Let $S = \{1\}$, then we know that $S$ is a $P_3$-set since $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$
is a prime. However, $S_{+3} = \{4\}$ and $4 + 4 + 4 = 12$ which is certainly not a prime $(12 = 2^2 * 3^1)$.
\end{quote}

\item[(d)]
Prove or Disprove: Every $P_3$ set contains a prime.
\begin{quote}
False. Counterexample: Let $S = \{1\}$, then 1 is not a prime but $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$ is a prime.
\end{quote}

\item[]
\item[]
\item[]

\item[(e)]
Prove or Disprove: The intersection of two $P_3$-sets is a $P_3$-set.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Let $A = \{1\}$, then $A$ is $P_3$-set since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 is a prime.
Let $B = \{2, 3\}$, then $2 + 2 + 3 = 7$ is a also prime thus $B$ is also a $P_3$-set. On the other hand,
$A \cap B = \emptyset$ which means that there are no elements $x,y,z$ such that $x + y + z$ is a prime and thus,
the intersection of two $P_3$-sets is not necessarily a $P_3$-set.
\end{quote} 

\item[]

\item[(f)]
Prove or Disprove: Every $P_3$-set contains an odd integer.
\begin{quote}
It's true. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is a $P_3$-set and it does not contain any odd integers. Then it must be the case that
all the elements of $S$ are even. Now, since all the elements are even, it means that no matter
what 3 elements $x, y$ and $z$ we take, their sum will always be even. On the other hand, the only even
prime we have is 2, but unfortunately there are no three numbers $x, y, z \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ which sum up to 2. The best we can do is 1 + 1 + 1
which is 3 and is one more than 2 (in all other cases the sum of three positive integers will be greater than 2).
Thus, there is no way to get 2 and otherwise, we won't have 3 elements which sum up to the prime. Hence,
we have reached the contradiction and $S$ is a not a $P_3$-set.

\item[(g)]
Prove or Disprove: Every infinite subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is a $P_3$-set.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample: Since we already proved that every $P_3$-set contains an odd integer,
we can take a set of all positive even integers which is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^+$. Let's call this subset $E$.
Then, we know that every element of the subset $E$ is even and sum of any 3 elements (not necessarily distinct)
will also be even. However, once again, the only even integer which is a prime is 2 and we cannot get 2 by summing
3 integers which are greater than or equal to 2 (greater than equal to 2 because $E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ...\}$).
\end{quote}

\item[]

\item[(h)]
Prove or Disprove: If $S$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}^+$, then $\mathbb{Z}^+ - S$ is a $P_3$-set.
\begin{quote}
It's true. Let's prove it by construction. Since $S$ is a finite set, we know that it cannot contain all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ because $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is infinite.
We already proved that there are infinitely many primes (in the previous chapter(s)).\ Thus, since $S$ is finite, it cannot possibly contain all the primes.
Then we can find a prime $p$ and integer $k$ such that $k, p - 2k \notin S$. Finally, let's have a look at the set $\mathbb{Z}^+ - S = \{k, p - 2k...\}$ which is a $P_3$-set
because $p - 2k + k + k = p$ is a prime.

\begin{itemize}
If a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is a $P_3$-set then the \textbf{core} of $S$ is the set
$$\mbox{core}(S) := \{s \in S \mid S - \{s\} \mbox{ is not a $P_3$-set}\}.$$

\item[]

\item[(a)]
What is the core of $S = \{2, 3, 6\}$?
\begin{quote}
The core of $S = \{2, 3, 6\}$ is core$(S) = \{2, 3\}$.
The reason is that if we take out $2$, we are left with 3 and 6 which are both multiples of 3 and any variations of their sums will never be a prime (3 + 3 + 3 is a not a prime, 3 + 6 + 3 is not a prime etc.).
If we take out 3, we are left with two even numbers, namely 2 and 6, and still we know that every $P_3$-set contains an odd integer thus, taking out 3 will leave us with non-$P_3$-set (any variations of the sums of the even integers will not be even; the only case is 2 but 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is the best we can do). On the other hand, if we take out 6, $S$ will still be a $P_3$-set since 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 is a prime.
Thus, core$(S) = \{2, 3\}$.
\end{quote}

\item[]

\item[(b)]
Give an example of a $P_3$-set whose core is the empty set, or prove none exists.
\begin{quote}
Here is an example: Let $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$. If we take out 1, we are left with $A = \{2, 3\}$
which is still a $P_3$-set because 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 is a prime. If we take out 2, we are left with
$B = \{1, 3\}$ which is still a $P_3$ set because 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 is a prime. Finally, if we take out
3, we are left with $C = \{1, 2\}$ which, once again, is a $P_3$-set. Thus, we've showed exhaustively
that no matter what we take out of $S$, it is still a $P_3$-set and hence, core$(S) = \emptyset$.
\end{quote}

\item[]

\item[(c)]
Give an example of a $P_3$-set whose core is infinite, or prove none exists.
\begin{quote}
There is no such $P_3$-set. In fact, there is no way for the core of the set to be bigger than 3.
Let's prove it. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, there exists a $P_3$-set $S$ such that its core is infinite. Let the core be the set $C = \{c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3 \ ...\}$.
Then we know that $S - \{c_0\}$ is not a $P_3$-set. Thus, $c_0$ must have contributed
to some summation of 3 elements (among which is $c_0$). Then, we also know that $S - \{c_1\}$
is not a $P_3$ set as well as $S - \{c_2\}$ is not a $P_3$-set. We also know that $S - \{c_4\}$
is not a $P_3$-set and we've reached the contradiction. The reason we've reached the contradiction
is that if there are 3 elements such that taking out either of those makes $S$ a non-$P_3$-set,
they, in the worst case, are in the same sum ($x = c_0, y = c_1, z = c_2$) and then taking out $c_4$ should not
make $S$ non-$P_3$-set (because $c_0, c_1$, and $c_3$ are still there). On the other hand, if $c_0, c_1, c_2$ are not in the same sum, we've reached
even "worse" contradiction since leaving $c_0$ for instance and taking out $c_1$ would still
result in $P_3$-set (the same logic, if $c_0, c_1, c_2$ are in the different sums it means that leaving
one of them would still give us a $P_3$ set). Without a loss of generality, if two of the $c_1, c_2, c_3$
are in the same sum, it means that $c_0, c_1$ (took them arbitrarily, without a loss of generality) are in some
sum in which $c_2$ plays no role. Then taking out $c_0$ or $c_1$ would still leave us with a $P_3$-set because
$c_2$ is there and if we take out $c_2$, then $c_0, c_1$ and some other member of the sum is still in the set
and we, once again, reach the contradiction. Thus, we've considered all the cases and have reached the contradiction.

\item[(d)]
Prove or Disprove: If $S$ is a $P_3$-set then core$(S)$ is a $P_3$-set. 
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample: Consider the set $S = \{2, 3, 5\}$. Then core$(S) = \{3\}$ since if we take out 2, 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 is still a prime and if we take out 5, 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 is still a prime. However, if we take out 3, all the possible sums are:\\
2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is not a prime\\
2 + 2 + 5 = 9 is not a prime\\
2 + 5 + 5 = 12 is not a prime\\
5 + 5 + 5 = 15 is not a prime\\

Thus, we end up with a set core$(S) = \{3\}$ which is not a $P_3$-set since 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 is the only sum we can get and it is not a prime.

\item[(e)]
Prove or Disprove: If $S$ and $T$ are $P_3$-sets then core$(S \cup T) \subseteq \mbox{ core}(S) \cap \mbox{ core}(T)$.
\begin{quote}
It's true, let's prove it. Let $x \in \mbox{core}(S \cup T)$. Then $x \in \mbox{core}(S)$ or $x \in \mbox{core}(T)$ (not the \textbf{exclusive} or). Now then, without a loss
of generality and for the sake of contradiction, assume that $x \in \mbox{core}(S)$ and $x \notin \mbox{core}(T)$. If $x \in \mbox{core}(S)$ and $x \notin \mbox{core}(T)$,
it means that $x \notin \mbox{core}(S \cup T)$ and we've reached the contradiction.

\item[(f)]
Prove or Disprove: If $S$ and $T$ are $P_3$-sets with $S \subseteq T$ then we have $\mbox{core}(T) \subseteq \mbox{ core}(S)$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose $S$ and $T$ are two $P_3$-sets and $S \subseteq T$. Then for all $x \in S$, $x \in T$.
Let $y \in \mbox{core}(T)$. Then since $T$ has all the elements of $S$ in addition to some other elements
which $S$ does not have (if they have the same elements, they are obviously equal and if $T = S$, $\mbox{core}(T) \subseteq \mbox{core}(S)$),
it is harder to make the set a non-$P_3$ because of simply having more elements to deal with.
Thus, if $T$ has simply more elements which do not contribute to any summation $x + y + z = p$ where $p$ is prime then $\mbox{core}(S) = \mbox{core}(T)$
and if there exist such numbers, then one has to take out the additions (e.g. $T$ has extra number $m$ which in not in $S$ and plays a role in some sum, then the core of
$T$ will obviously shrink). Thus, if $S$ and $T$ are $P_3$-sets and $S \subseteq T$, then $\mbox{core}(T) \subseteq \mbox{core}(S)$.

A subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is called threequaline if for every $x, y \in S$ one has $3 \mid (x - y)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Prove or Disprove: Every subset of a threequaline set is threequaline.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is a threequaline set and also suppose that all the subsets of $S$ are threequaline.
Then we know that an empty set is a subset of every set and $S$ is a set thus, the emptyset is also a subset of $S$.
However, the empty set has no elements and we cannot find $x, y$ such that $x - y$ is a multiple of 3 and we've reached the contradiction.

Prove that if $S$ is threequaline than either every element of $S$ is divisible by 3 or none are.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is a threequaline set and there exists two elements
$x, y$ such that $x$ is a multiple of 3 and $y$ is not a multiple of 3.
Then, without a loss of generality, consider the following two cases:\\\\
Case I: $x = 3k$ and $y = 3l + 1$ where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$\\
Case II: $x = 3k$ and $y = 3l + 2$ where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$.\\\\
Case I Proof: if $x = 3k$ and $y = 3l + 1$, $x + y = 3k + 3l + 1 = 3(k + l) + 1$ which is not a multiple of 3.\\\\
Case II Proof: if $x = 3k$ and $y = 3l + 2$, $x + y = 3k + 3l + 2 = 3(k + l) + 2$ which is not a multiple of 3.

Prove that if $S$ is threequaline and $r$ and $t$ are integers, then the set $\{rx + t \mid x \in S\}$ is also threequaline.
\begin{quote}
Since we know that $S$ is a threequaline set, for every $x, y \in S$, $x - y$ is a multiple of 3. Suppose, $z_1, z_2$ are some elements of the set $S$.
Then, we know that $z_1 - z_2$ is a multiple of 3. The new set will ``transform" these elements into $z_1^{'} = rz_1 + t$ and $z_2^{'} = rz_2 + t$.
On the other hand, $z_1^{'} - z_2^{'} = rz_1 + t - (rz_2 + t) = r(z_1 - z_2)$ which is a multiple of 3 since $z_1, z_2$ are the members of $S$ and
$z_1 - z_2$ is a multiple of 3.

Prove that if $S$ and $T$ are threequaline and $S \ \cap \ T \neq \emptyset$ then $S \ \cup \ T$ is threequaline.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S_1$ and $S_2$ are threequaline sets and $S_1 \ \cap \ S_2 \neq \emptyset$ and let's prove that
$S_1 \ \cup \ S_2$ is not a threequaline. Since $S_1 \cap S_2 \neq 0$, there exists element $x$, such that $x \in S_1$ and $x \in S_2$.
Let's consider the following cases:\\\\
Case I : $x$ is divisible by 3, thus $x = 3k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$\\
Case II: $x$ gives remainder of 1 when divided by 3, thus $x = 3k + 1$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$\\
Case III: $x$ gives remainder of 2 when divided by 3, thus $x = 3k + 2$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$\\\\
In Case I, if $x = 3k$, then all the other elements of $S_1$ as well as $S_2$ must be of the type $3l$ where $l \in \mathbb{Z}$
and all the elements in the union of $S_1$ and $S_2$ will be the multiples of 3 which means that for all $i, j \in S_1 \cup S_2$,
$i - j$ is a multiple of 3. And we reached the contradiction.\\\\
In Case II, if $x = 3k + 1$, then all the other elements of $S_1$ as well as $S_2$ must be of the type $3l + 1$ where $l \in \mathbb{Z}$
and all the elements in the union of $S_1$ and $S_2$ will be the multiples of 3 plus 1 which means that for all $i, j \in S_1 \cup S_2$,
$i - j$ is a multiple of 3. And we reached the contradiction.\\\\
In Case II, if $x = 3k + 2$, then all the other elements of $S_1$ as well as $S_2$ must be of the type $3l + 2$ where $l \in \mathbb{Z}$
and all the elements in the union of $S_1$ and $S_2$ will be the multiples of 3 plus 2 which means that for all $i, j \in S_1 \cup S_2$,
$i - j$ is a multiple of 3. And we reached the contradiction.

$S_4 = \{2,4,6 ...\}$ (a set of positive even numbers) is not crunched as it has no upper bound and we cannot find $n$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{Z^+}, m< x < n$ (note: we can find $m$. $m$ can be any integer that is less than or equal to 1 but $n$ cannot be fixed).

Suppose $A$ is a balanced set, then we know that $|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap A| = |\mathbb{Z}^- \cap A|$.
Now, since $0 \notin \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $0 \notin \mathbb{Z}^-$, it means that
$\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap A = \mathbb{Z}^+ \cap (A \cup \{0\})$ and
$\mathbb{Z}^- \cap A = \mathbb{Z}^- \cap (A \cup \{0\})$

since $S_1 \cap S_2 = \{-1\}$ and $|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap (S_1 \cap S_2)| = \emptyset$ while $|\mathbb{Z}^- \cap (S_1 \cap S_2)| = 1$.

Prove or Disprove: For every $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ there exists a balanced set $S$ with exactly $n$ elements.
\begin{quote}
It's true. Let's prove it by construction. Let $S$ be a set and for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, dump in some elements to make it balanced.
If $n$ is even, then we take $n/2$ elements that are positive
and $n/2$ elements that are negative which will give us a balanced set since $|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap S| = |\mathbb{Z}^- \cap S|$.
If $n$ is odd, then we can throw in $0$ and then take $(n - 1)/2$ positive elements and $(n - 1)/2$ negative elements.
This will guarantee that $|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap S| = |\mathbb{Z}^- \cap S|$ since there will be exactly same number of positive and negative
elements while 0 is neither in $\mathbb{Z}^+$, nor in $\mathbb{Z}^-$.

If $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ we denote by $\overline{A}$ the set $\{-a \ | \ a \in A\}$. Prove or Disprove:
For every finite subset of $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}$, the set $A \cup \overline{A}$ is balanced.
\begin{quote}
It's true. Let's prove it by cases.\\\\
Case I: suppose that $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ such that it does not contain 0.\\
Case II: suppose that $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ such that it does contain 0.
\\\\\\
Proof of Case I: If $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ such that it does not contain 0, we know that for all $x \in A$,
we have $-x \in \overline{A}$. This means that the number of negative elements in $A \cup \overline{A}$
will be equal to the number of positive elements in $A \cup \overline{A}$ and because of this,
$|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap (A \cup \overline{A})| = |\mathbb{Z}^- \cap (A \cup \overline{A})|$.\\

Proof of Case II: If $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ such that it does contain 0, for all $x \in A$,
we have $-x \in \overline{A}$. This means that if we took out 0 out of $A \cup \overline{A}$, the number
of positive and negative elements in $A \cup \overline{A}$ would be equal. On the other hand, 0 plays no role
in determining whether $|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap (A \cup \overline{A})| = |\mathbb{Z}^- \cap (A \cup \overline{A})|$
or not because $0 \notin \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $0 \notin \mathbb{Z}^-$. Thus, $|\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap (A \cup \overline{A})| = |\mathbb{Z}^- \cap (A \cup \overline{A})|$.

\begin{quote}
It's true so let's prove it. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $A$ is balanced
and $|A|$ is odd, but $0 \notin A$. Now, since $|A|$ is odd, it means that there is no way
to have the number of positive elements be equal to the number of negative elements and we've
reached a contradiction.

We call a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ \textbf{positively scattered} if for every $x \in S$
there exists $y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $y > x$ and $S \cap (x,y] = \emptyset$.\\

NOTE: The statement above really means that for every $x \in S$, there exists some $y > 0 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $S \cap (x, x + y] = \emptyset.$

Is $\mathbb{Z}^+$ positively scattered? 
\begin{quote}
It is. Let's prove it by construction. If we take some element $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, then we know that it is positive.
If $y > x$, we know that $y$ is also positive and let $y = x + 0.1$. Then, we know that interval $(x, x + 0.1]$
contains no positive integers and thus, $\mathbb{Z}^+ \cap (x, x + 01] = \emptyset$. Hence, for all $e \in \mathbb{Z}$, we can
construct $(e, e+0.1]$ (there are no positive integers in this interval) and finally, $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is indeed positively\
scattered.

Is $[2, 3]$ positively scattered? 
\begin{quote}
It is not. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that for all $x \in [2, 3]$, there
exists $y$ such that $y > x$ and $[2, 3] \cap (x, y] = \emptyset$. Now, since the condition
holds for all $x \in [2, 3]$ and $[2, 3]$ is a closed interval, it should hold for 2 as well.
Then, let $x = 2$. If the condition holds for $x = 2$, it means that we can find $y > x$ such
that $[2, 3] \cap (2, y] = \emptyset$. Since $y > x$, $y = 2 + t$ where $t > 0$. Thus,
we have $[2, 3] \cap (2, 2 + t] = \emptyset$, but this is impossible and to see why, let's
consider two cases:\\\\
Case I: $t \geq 1$\\
Case I: $0 < t <  1$\\\\
If $t \geq 1$, it means that $[2, 3] \cap (2, 2 + t] = (2, 3]$ and we have reach the contradiction.\\\\
If $0 < t < 1$, it means that $[2, 3] \cap (2, 2 + t] = (2, 2 + t]$ and interval $(2, 2 + t)$ is obviously infinite. Thus, we have, once again, reached the contradiction.\\\\
Thus, in all cases we've reached the contradiction and $[2, 3]$ is not positively scattered.

Is $\{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}$ positively scattered?
\begin{quote}
It is. Let's prove it by construction. Let $x \in \{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}$, then
we know that $x = \dfrac{1}{k}$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Now, let's take $y = \dfrac{1}{k + 0.5}$.
Then, we know that $\{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cap (\dfrac{1}{k}, \dfrac{1}{k + 0.5}] = \emptyset$
because $n$ is always an integer and there are no integer denominators in the interval $(k, k + 0.5]$.

Is $\{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cup \{0\}$ positively scattered? 
\begin{quote}
It is not. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cup \{0\}$
is scattered. Then for all $x \in \{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cup \{0\}$, there exist
$y > x$, such that $(\{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cup \{0\}) \cap (x,y] = \emptyset$.
If the condition holds for all $x \in \{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cup \{0\}$, it should hold
for $x = 0$ too ($x = 0$ is the member of the set).
If $x = 0$, there must exist $y > 0$ such that $(\{\dfrac{1}{n} \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\} \cup \{0\}) \cap (0,y] = \emptyset$.
This, however, is impossible since the interval $(0, y]$ is infinite and we can always find $n$ for which
$\dfrac{1}{n} \in (0, y]$. Thus, we've reached the contradiction.

Prove or Disprove: A subset of a positively scattered set is positively scattered.
\begin{quote}
It's true.\\
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the set $S_0$ is a subset of the positively
scattered set $S$ and that $S_0$ is not positively scattered. Then we know that for some
$x \in S_0$, there is no $y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $y > x$ and $S \cap (x, y] = \emptyset$.
$S_0$, however, is a subset of $S$ which means that if $x \in S_0$, then $x \in S$. Finally, we have
that for some $x \in S$ there is no $y$ such that $S \cap (x, x + y] = \emptyset$
which means that $S$ is not positively scattered. Thus, we've reached the contradiction since we
assumed that $S$ was positively scattered.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S = S_1 \cup S_2$ and let $x \in S$. Then we know that $x \in S_1$ or $x \in S_2$.
Without the loss of generality suppose that $x \in S_1$, we can find $y > 0$ such that $(x, x + y]$ not in $S_1$. Then,
the only way we cannot find $k > 0$ such that $(x, x + k) \cap S \neq \emptyset$ is if $S_2$ contains the part of the interval
thus, infinitely many numbers in the range $(x, x + k]$. But then $S_2$ would not be positively scattered,
because since it contains all the elements in the range $(x, x + k]$, it means that for all $l \in \mathbb{R}$,
$(x, l] \cap S_2 \neq \emptyset$. Thus, we have reached the contradiction and the union of two scattered sets is indeed scattered.

It's true. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is a positively scattered set. Then, consider $\mathbb{R} - S$.
If $\mathbb{R} - S$ is scattered, it must be the case that all the sets in $\mathbb{R}$ are scattered which is not true

Prove or Disprove: If S is positively scattered then the set $\overline{S} := \{-x \ | \ x \in S \}$ is positively scattered.
\begin{quote}
It's true. Suppose, $S$ is a positively scattered set. Let $x \in S$. We know that for some $y$, $(x, x + y] \cap S = \emptyset$.
Then we also know that in $\overline{S}$, $x$ will be mapped to $-x$. Note that $\overline{S}$ will be absolutely ``symmetric"
which means that if $y$ worked for $S$, it will also work for $\overline {S}$. In ``symmetric" I really mean the difference between
two elements next to each other ($x_1 - x_2 = -x_2 - (-x_1)$). Then we can take the same $y$, and for $-x \in \overline{S}$,
$(-x, -x + y] \cap \overline{S} = \emptyset$.
