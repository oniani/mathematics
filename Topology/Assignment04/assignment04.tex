Let $A \subset X$. Show that if $C$ is a connected subspace of $X$
that intersects both $A$ and $X - A$, then $C$ intersects $\mbox{Bd} \ A$.
\begin{quote}
At first, recall that $\mbox{Bd} \ A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X - A}$.
Now, suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $C$ is connected and $C \cap \mbox{Bd} \ A = \emptyset$.
Consider two sets $U_1 = C \cap \overline{A}$ and $U_2 = C \cap \overline{X - A}$.
Now, since $C \cap A \subset U_1$ and $C \cap \overline{X - A} \subset U_2$, it follows
from our assumptions that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are two nonempty subsets of $C$.
Notice that $C = U_1 \cup U_2$ with $U_1, U_2$ being both open and closed subsets of $C$.
However, $U_1 \cap U_2 = C \cap \overline{A} \cap \overline{X - A} = C \cap \mbox{Bd} \ A = \emptyset$
which means that $C$ is disconnected and contradicts the fact that $C$ is connected.\
Finally, we have reached the contradiction and $C$ intersects $\mbox{Bd} \ A$.$\qed$

\begin{itemize}
\item[(c)]
Show that $\reals^n$ and $\reals$ are not homeomorphic if $n > 1$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that for $n > 1$, $\reals^n$ and $\reals$
are homeomorphic. Then, by the definition of homeomorphism, there exists a function
$f : \reals \to \reals^n$. Consider $\left.f \right|_{\reals^n-\{0\}} : \reals^n-\{0\} \to \reals - \{f(0)\}$,
$\left.f \right|_{\reals^n-\{0\}}$ is a restriction of $f$ and hence is a homeomorphism.
Now, notice that $\reals^n-\{0\}$ is a connected space, however, $\reals-\{f(0)\}$ is not a connected
space and we have reached the contradiction since $\left.f \right|_{\reals^n-\{0\}}$ is a homeomorphism.
Finally, we have that for $n > 1$, $\reals^n$ and $\reals$ are not homeomorphic.
In short, by taking away $0$, we make $\reals$ disconnected, but taking away any point from $\reals^n$
leaves it connected.$\qed$

Let $f : X \to X$ be continuous. Show that if $X = [0, 1]$,
there is a point $x$ such that $f(x) = x$. The point $x$
is called a \textbf{\textit{fixed point}} of $f$. What happens if $X$
equals $[0, 1)$ or $(0, 1)$?
\begin{quote}
In the order topology, $X$ is an ordered set and connected space.
Let $a, b \in X$. Let's now pick a midpoint $x_1$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
Then, according to \textbf{Theorem 24.3}, $\exists c_1 \in [a, b]$ such that
$f(c_1) = x_1$. Now, if $c_1 = x_1$, we found the fixed point of $f$ and if $c_1 \neq x_1$, we pick the midpoint $x_2$ between $c_1$ and $x_1$.
Then $\exists c_2 \in [c_1, x_1]$ or $c_2 \in [x_1, c_1]$ (depending on whether $x_1 > c_1$ or $c_1 > x_1$) such that 
$f(c_2) = x_2$. Now, if $c_2 = x_2$ then we have found the point and if not we countinue
this way. Thinking of computer science, this is a recursive approach to the problem (though, I think recursion comes from math anyway, right?).
The simply outline of the algorithm would look something like this:
\begin{algorithmic}
    \IF{$x_n = c_n$}
        \STATE hooray! we have found a point! we are done, return the point!
    \ELSE
        \STATE Consider the midpoint between $x_n$ and $c_n$
    \ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}

After repeating this process, we will end up with two convergent series: $c_1, c_2, c_3, ...$ and $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...$ with the property that $\abs{c_n - x_n} \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$. In others words, we have $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty}\abs{c_n - x_n} \to 0$. This is due to the continuity
of $f$ on $X$. Therefore, we have $\abs{x_n - f(x_n)} = \abs{f(c_n) - f(x_n)} \to 0$ from which we get that $f(x_n) = (x_n)$.$\qed$

This fact/theorem does not hold for intervals $[0, 1)$ and $(0, 1)$. This is due to\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
$f$ not being uniformly continuous on these intervals. For instance, a function\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
$f(x) = \dfrac{x + 2}{3}$ has a fixed point $x = 1$, but
\vspace{0.25cm}
it has no fixed points on intervals $[0, 1)$\\
 or $(0, 1)$.

Is a product of path-connected spaces necessarily path-connected?
\begin{quote}
Yes.

\item[(b)]
If $A \subset X$ and $A$ is path-connected, is $\bar{A}$
necessarily path-connected?
\begin{quote}
No. For instance, \textbf{\textit{topologist's sine curve}}.
\end{quote}

\item[]

\item[(c)]
If $f: X \to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is path-connected, is $f(X)$ necessarily path-connected?
\begin{quote}
Yes, this is due to the fact that the composition of continuous functions is always continuous.
\end{quote}

Yes

Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint compact subspaces of the Hausdorff space $X$. Show that there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ containing $A$ and $B$, respectively.
\begin{quote}
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint compact subspaces
of the Hausdorff space $X$. Now, let $p$ be some arbitrary
points in $A$. Then the points of $p$ are not in $Y$
