\begin{enumerate}
\item[7.]
List three elements of each of the following sets.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
$\mathbb{Q} \cap (2,3)$\\\\
Since $(2,3)$ is an open range from $2$ to $3$ (not including $2$ and $3$),
all of it is in the $\mathbb{Q}$ and the answer of the intersection is $(2,3)$.\\

Here are three elements that are the result set: $2.1,2.2,2.3$
\\
\item[(b)]
$\{2^n - 1 \ \vert \ n \in \mathbb{Z^+} \}$\\

If $n=1$, then \ $2^n - 1 = 1$\\
If $n=2$, then \ $2^n - 1 = 3$\\
If $n=3$, then \ $2^n - 1 = 7$\\\\
Here are three elements that are the result set: $1,3,7$
\\
\item[(c)]
$\{n \in \mathbb{Z^+} \ \vert \ n^2 + 1 \ \textnormal{is prime} \}$\\

If $n=1$, then \ $n^2 + 1 = 2$ and 2 is a prime\\
If $n=2$, then \ $n^2 + 1 = 5$ and 3 is a prime\\
If $n=4$, then \ $n^2 + 1 = 17$ and 17 is a prime\\\\
Here are three elements that are the result set: $2,3,17$
\end{enumerate}

\

\item[8.]
Let $A = [4,7]$ and $B = (6,8)$, both subsets of the universal set
$\mathbb{R}$. Write each of the following sets as naturally as possible:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
$A \cup B$\\

$A \cup B = [4,8]$. Thus, the set $A \cup B$ is the set of all real numbers
from 4 to 8, 4 and 8 inclusive.
\\
\item[(b)]
$A \cap B$\\

$A \cap B = (6,7]$. Thus, the set $A \cap B = (6,7]$ is the set of all real numbers
from 6 to 7, not including 6 but including 7.
\\
\item[(c)]
$A^C$\\

$A^C = (-\infty, 4) \ \cup \ (7, +\infty)$. Thus, the set $A^C$ is the set of all real numbers
but those in the range $[4,7]$, not including $4$ and $7$ (also called the \textit{complement} of $A$).
\\
\item[(d)]
$B^C$\\

$B^C = (-\infty, 6] \ \cup \ [8, +\infty)$. Thus, the set $B^C$ is the set of all real numbers
but those in the range $(6,8)$, including $4$ and $7$ (also called the \textit{complement} of $B$).
\\

\item[(e)]
$A - B$\\

$A - B = [4,6]$. Thus, the set $B^C$ is the set of all real numbers
in the range $[4,6]$, $4$ and $6$ inclusive.
\end{enumerate}

\

\item[9.]
A \textbf{bi-partition} of a set $S$ is a set $\{A,B\}$ of two subsets
$A$ and $B$ of $S$ such that $A \cup B = S$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
List all bi-partitions of the set $\{1,2,3\}$.
\\

The list of all bi-partitions of the set $\{1,2,3\}$ is:
\begin{center}
$\{\emptyset\}$ and $\{1,2,3\}$\\
$\{1\}$ and $\{2,3\}$\\
$\{2\}$ and $\{1,3\}$\\
$\{3\}$ and $\{1,2\}$\\
\end{center}
The list above shows that there are four bi-partitions for the given set.
\\
\item[(b)]
Explain why, every subset $A$ of a set $S$ is an element of exactly one bi-partition of
$S$. (Hint: First explain why every such $A$ is an element of at least one bi-partition
of $S$, then explain why it cannot be be an element of more than one bi-partition
of $S$.)
\\

$A$ is an element of at least one bi-partition since the list of bi-partitions of $B$
are really the sets of paired subsets of $B$. If we list all the bi-partition subset pairs,
we will get all the subsets of $B$. Then if we have all the subsets of $B$, $A$ is just one
of them and it has to be one of the bi-partitions.
\\
\item[(c)]
It is a fact that we will prove later that if $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \}$, then $S$
has exactly 1024 subsets. How many bi-partitions does S have?\\

Actually, let's prove it now and then count the number of bi-partitions.\\
So, for each element of the set, we have two options, either put in the subset
or leave it off. We have $10$ elements in the set $S$. $2^{10} = 1024$.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D}
\end{flushright}
Now, let's go ahead and count the number of bi-partitions for the set.\\
\begin{center}
$\{\emptyset\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{1\}$ and $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{2\}$ and $\{1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{3\}$ and $\{1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{4\}$ and $\{1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{5\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{6\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{7\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10\}$\\
$\{8\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10\}$\\
$\{9\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10\}$\\
$\{10\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$\\
\end{center}
Thus, we see that the number of the bi-partitions for the set $S$ is 11.
In fact, for any given set $A$, the number of its bi-partitions will be
$|A| + 1$.
\end{enumerate}
\item[2.]
Write down two sets each having infinitely many elements.
Do parts (a)--(c) for these sets.\\

Let's look at two infinite sets $A = \{x \in \mathbb{Z^+} \ \vert \ 2x \}$
and $B = \{x \in \mathbb{Z^+} \ \vert \ 2x - 1 \}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
What is their union?\\
\\
$A \cup B = \mathbb{Z}^+$
\\
\item[(a)]
What is their intersection?\\
\\
$A \cap B = \emptyset$
\\
\item[(a)]
What is their set difference? (both of them)\\

$A - B = A$\\
$B - A = B$
\end{enumerate}

\item[6.]
List the elements in each of the following sets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(h)]
$\{x \in \mathbb{R} \ \vert \ x^3 - 3x = 0\}$\\

If $x^3 - 3x = 0$, then the solutions to the equation
are $0,\sqrt{3}$ and $-\sqrt{3}$.\\
Thus the elements of the set are $0,\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{3}$.
\\
\item[(h)]
$\{x \in \mathbb{R} \ \vert \ x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0\}$\\

Equation $x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0$ has no solutions.\\
Thus the set is $\emptyset$.
\\
\end{enumerate}

\item[7.]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c).]
Show that $\{x \in \mathbb{R} \ \vert \ (x-1/2)(x-1/3)<0\} \subseteq \{x \in \mathbb{R} \ \vert \ 0 < x < 1\}$.
Check your answer.\\

The solution set for the equation $(x-1/2)(x-1/3)$ is $\{1/2,1/3\}$. Thus, $\{x \in \mathbb{R} \ \vert \ (x-1/2)(x-1/3)<0\} = \{1/2,1/3\}$.
$\{x \in \mathbb{R} \ \vert \ 0 < x < 1\}$ the set of all elements of the open range $(0,1)$.
$1/2 \in (0,1)$ and $1/3 \in (0,1)$.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D}
\end{flushright}
\end{enumerate}

\item[14.]
A set $A$ is called \textit{full} if any element of $A$ is also a subset of $A$.
In other words, $A$ is full if $x \in A$ implies $x \subseteq A$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
Show that $\{\emptyset\}$ is full.\\

Set $\{\emptyset\}$ has only one element, namely $\emptyset$, and $\emptyset \subseteq \{\emptyset\}$.
Hence, $\{\emptyset\}$ is full.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D}
\end{flushright}
\item[(b)]
Find a full set having exactly two elements.\\

$\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$.
\\
\item[(c)]
Find a full set having exactly three elements.\\

$\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\},\{\{\emptyset\}\}\}$.
\end{enumerate}

\

\item[19.]
Russell's Paradox. Let $S = \{A \ \vert \ A \ \textnormal{is a set and} \ A \notin A\}$.
Suppose that $S$ itself is a set.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
Show that if $S$ is a member of itself, then $S$ cannot be a member of itself.\\

If $S \in S$, then $S \notin S$ as $S$ is a subset of $S$ and for every subset $A$
of $S$, if $A \in S$, then $A \notin S$.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D}
\end{flushright}
\item[(b)]
Show that if $S$ is not a member of itself, then $S$ must be a member of itself.\\

Since $S$ is a set, it has to have members.
Thus, if $S$ is not a member of itself, then $S$ must be a member of itself.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D}
\end{flushright}

\item[10.]
An integer $n$ is called doubly even if there exist even integers $x$ and $y$ such that $n = xy$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
Is 12 doubly even? Prove your answer.\\

Yes, it is doublt even since $12 = 2 \times 6$ where $2$ and $6$ are even.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D.}
\end{flushright}
\item[(b)]
Is 98 doubly even? Prove your answer.? Prove your answer.\\

No, it is not doubly even since $98 = 2 \times 47$ where $2$ and $47$ is odd.
Thus, since it is not divisible by 4, it is not doubly even.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D.}
\end{flushright}
\item[(c)]
Write the negation of the statement “n is doubly even” without using the word
“not.”\\

$n$ contains only one power of 2. In other words, $n = 2k$ where $k$ is odd.

\item[(d)]
For what positive integers $n$ is $n!$ doubly even? Prove your answer.\\

For $n \geq 4$. Let's prove it!

For a number $n$ to be doubly-even, it should be divisible by $4$
(if $n = xy$ where $x$ and $y$ are even, then let $x = 2i$ and $y = 2j$
where $i,j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we get $n = 4ij$ which proves that $n$ is
indeed divisible by $4$). From this fact, we can deduce that $n!$ must
be divisible by $4$ which happens for $n \geq 4$. Thus, if $n \geq 4$, $n!$
is doubly even.
