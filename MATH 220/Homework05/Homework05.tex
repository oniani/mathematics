\begin{enumerate}
\item[23.]
Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are integers and $xy - 1$ is even then $x$ and $y$ are odd.
\begin{quote}
Let's prove it by contrapositive. Contrapositive of the initial statement (which is equivalent to the initial statement) is:
\begin{center}
If $x$ is even or $y$ is even, then $xy - 1$ is odd.
\end{center}
If $x$ is even or $y$ is even, $xy$ is even. Then we can write that $xy = 2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then, $xy - 1 = 2k - 1 = 2(k - 1) + 1$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Now, let $t = l - 1$ where $l \in \mathbb{Z}$
and we get $xy - 1 = 2t + 1$. Thus, $xy - 1$ is odd.

\item[24.]
Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers whose mean is $m$ then at least one of\\
$x$ and $y$ is $\geq m$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x$ and $y$ are both $< m$.
Then by adding the inequalities, we get:
$$
x + y < 2m
$$
And finally,
$$
\dfrac{x + y}{2} < m
$$
which contradicts the initial statement that the mean of $x$ and $y$ is $m$.

\item[25.]
Suppose $S$ is a set of 250 distinct real numbers whose mean is 4. Must there exists
$x \in S$ such that $x > 4$? Be sure to prove your answer.
\begin{quote}
Yes. Let's prove it!\\
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all elements of $S$ are $\leq 4$.
Then the sum of all the elements will be less $\leq 1000$ with equality happening only
when all the members of the set are equal to $4$ which contradict the initial statement that
$S$ is a set of 250 \underline{distinct} elements. Thus, only one of the elements of $S$ is allowed
to be equal to 4. Finally, we get two cases:
\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]
All 250 elements of $S$ are less than 4.
\item[2.]
249 elements of $S$ are less than 4 and one is equal to 4.
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
If all 250 elements of $S$ are less than 4, then their sum is less than $4 \times 250 = 1000$ and their mean
is less than $1000 / 4 = 250$ which contradicts the initial statement that the mean of all elements of $S$ is 250.

If 249 elements of $S$ are less than 4 and one is equal to 4, then the sum of 249 elements which are less than 4 is less than
$249 \times 4 = 996$. Then let this sum of 249 numbers be equal to $996 - k$ where $k > 0$. Then the sum of all the elements including
the one which equals 4 is:
$$
996 - k + 4 = 1000 - k \mbox{ where } k > 0
$$
Using the fact above, we get that the mean of all the elements of $S$ is $(1000 - k)/250$ where $k > 0$.
And finally, we get:
$$
\dfrac{1000 - k}{250} = 4 - \dfrac{k}{250} \mbox{ where } k > 0
$$
And $4 - \dfrac{k}{250} \mbox{ where } k > 0$ is clearly less than 4 which contradicts
the initial claim that the mean of all elements of $S$ is 4.

\item[26.]
Suppose $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Prove that at least one of a and b is even.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that both $a$ and $b$ are odd.
Then, we can write $a = 2k - 1$ and $b = 2l - 1$ where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then, we have:
$$
a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 + 4l^2 - 4l + 1 = 4k^2 + 4l^2 - 4l - 4k + 2 = \\
$$
$$
= 2 \times (2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1)
$$

Now, it's easy to see that $a^2 + b^2$ is the multiplication of an even and odd
integers ($2$ is even and $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1$ is odd). $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1$ is
odd since $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1 = 2 \times (k^2 + l^2 - l - k) + 1$ and if we let $t = k^2 + l^2 - l - k$
where $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ (since $k^2 + l^2 - l - k \in \mathbb{Z}$), then we have that $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1 = 2t + 1$
which is an even number plus one which is always odd. Finally, we conclude that $2$ is only once in the number that is supposed to be a perfect square as
$2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1$ is odd and is not a multiple of 2 which means
that $a^2 + b^2$ is not a perfect square which contradicts the initial claim that the sum
$a^2 + b^2$ is the perfect square.

\item[27.]
Prove that if $x,y \in \mathbb{R^+}$, then $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x + y < 2\sqrt{xy}$.
Then, since $x,y \in \mathbb{R^+}$, we have:
\begin{align}
x + y < 2\sqrt{xy}\\
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy < 4xy\\
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy -4xy < 0\\
x^2 + y^2 - 2xy < 0\\
(x - y)^2 < 0
\end{align}
Thus, we got that $(x-y)^2 < 0$ which is false since the square of a number
is always $\geq 0$. Finally, since by assuming that $x + y < 2 \sqrt{xy} \mbox{ where } x, y\in \mathbb{R^+}$, we basically
got the nonsensical inequality $(x-y)^2 < 0$, something has to be wrong with this assumption and we got that
if $x,y \in \mathbb{R^+}$, then $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$

\item[28.]
Prove that if $n$ is an integer, there exist three consecutive integers that sum\\
to $n$ if and only if $n$ is a multiple of 3.
\begin{quote}
Let's first prove that if $n$ is not a multiple of 3, one cannot find
three consecutive integers with the property that they sum to $n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $n$ is not a multiple of 3.
Then let's define three consecutive integers, $m, m + 1$ and $m + 2$, where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then we have:
$$
m + m + 1 + m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3 \times (m + 1)
$$
Thus, we got that the sum of three consecutive integers is a multiple of 3
which contradicts the statement that $n$ is not a multiple of 3.
\end{itemize}
Now, lets prove the second half of the problem. Let's show that
if three consecutive integers sum to $n$, then $n$ is a multiple
of 3.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(b)]
Let $m, m+1, m+2$ where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ be three consecutive integers.
We have:
$$
n = m + m + 1 + m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3\times(m+1)
$$
Thus, we got that $n$ is a multiple of 3 which proves the iff.
\end{itemize}

\item[29.]
A subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ has the property that for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$
there exists $y \in S$ such that $|x - y| < 1$. Prove that $S$ is infinite.

\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is finite.
Inequality, $|x - y| < 1$ can be transformed into the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
x - y < 1\\
x - y > -1
\end{cases}
$$
And from the system above, we get the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
y > x - 1\\
y < x + 1
\end{cases}
$$
Hence, we know that $y$ is in the open interval $(x-1, x+1)$.
Now, since we also know that $x \in \mathbb{R}$, interval $(x-1, x+1)$
has infinitely many elements in it which contradicts our assumption
that $S$ is finite.
