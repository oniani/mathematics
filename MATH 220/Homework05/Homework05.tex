\item[23.]
Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are integers and $xy - 1$ is even then $x$ and $y$ are odd.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x \textnormal{ is even or } y \textnormal{ is even}$.
Then we know that the multiplication $xy$ is even (since we assumed the statement $x$ is even or $y$ is even is right).
By the definition of an even number, $xy = 2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Finally, $xy - 1 = 2k - 1$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ which now appears to be the definition
of the odd number which contradicts the fact that $xy - 1$ is even.

\item[24.]
Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers whose mean is $m$ then at least one of\\
$x$ and $y$ is $\geq m$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x$ and $y$ are both $< m$.
Then by adding the inequalities, we get:
$$
x + y < 2m
$$
And finally,
$$
\dfrac{x + y}{2} < m
$$
which contradicts the initial statement that the mean of $x$ and $y$ is $m$.

\item[25.]
Suppose $S$ is a set of 250 distinct real numbers whose mean is 4. Must there exists
$x \in S$ such that $x > 4$? Be sure to prove your answer.
\begin{quote}
Yes. Let's prove it!\\
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all elements of $S$ are $\leq 4$.
Then the sum of all the elements will be less $\leq 1000$ with equality happening only
when all the members of the set are equal to $4$ which contradict the initial statement that
$S$ is a set of 250 distinct elements. Thus, all elements of $S$ must be strictly $< 4$.
This now means that their sum is less than $1000$ which, once again, contradicts the initial
statement that the mean of all the elements of $S$ is  $250 \times 4 = 1000$.

\end{quote}

\item[26.]
Suppose $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Prove that at least one of a and b is even.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that both $a$ and $b$ are odd.
Then, we can write $a = 2k - 1$ and $b = 2l - 1$ where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then, we have:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 + 4l^2 - 4l + 1 = 4k^2 + 4l^2 - 4l - 4k + 2 = \\
$$
$$
= 2 \times (2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1)
$$

Now, it's easy to see that $a^2 + b^2$ is the multiplication of an even and odd
integers ($2$ is even and $(2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1)$ is odd). Finally, we conclude
that $2$ is only once in the number that is supposed to be a perfect square which means
that $a^2 + b^2$ is not a perfect square.

\item[27.]
Prove that if $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^+$,then $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x + y < 2\sqrt{xy}$.
Then, since $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^+$, we have:
\begin{align}
x + y < 2\sqrt{xy}\\
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy < 4xy\\
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy -4xy < 0\\
x^2 + y^2 - 2xy < 0\\
(x - y)^2 < 0
\end{align}
Thus, we got that $(x-y)^2 < 0$ which is false since square of a number
is always $\geq 0$.

\end{quote}

\item[28.]
Prove that if $n$ is an integer, there exist three consecutive integers that sum\\
to $n$ if and only if $n$ is a multiple of 3.
\begin{quote}
Let's first prove that if $n$ is not a multiple of 3, one cannot find
three consecutive integers with the property that they sum to $n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $n$ is not a multiple of 3.
Then let's define three consecutive integers, $m, m + 1$ and $m + 2$, where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then we have:
$$
m + m + 1 + m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3 \times (m + 1)
$$
Thus, we got that the sum of three consecutive integers is a multiple of three
which contradicts the statement that $n$ is not a multiple of 3.
\end{itemize}
Now, lets prove the second half of the problem. Let's show that
if three consecutive integers sum to $n$, then $n$ is a multiple
of 3.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(b)]
Let $m, m+1, m+2$ where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ be three consecutive integers.
We have:
$$
n = m + m + 1 + m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3\times(m+1)
$$
Thus, we got that $n$ is a multiple of 3 which proves the iff.
\end{itemize}

\end{quote}


\item[29.]
A subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ has the property that for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$
there exists $y \in S$ such that $|x - y| < 1$. Prove that $S$ is infinite.

\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is finite.
Inequality, $|x - y| < 1$ can be transformed into the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
x - y < 1\\
x - y > -1
\end{cases}
$$
And from the system above, we get the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
y > x - 1\\
y < x + 1
\end{cases}
$$
Hence, we know that $y$ is in the open interval $(x-1, x+1)$.
Now, since we also know that $x \in \mathbb{R}$, interval $(x-1, x+1)$
has infinitely many elements in it which contradicts our assumption
that $S$ is finite.
