\begin{enumerate}
\item[23.]
Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are integers and $xy - 1$ is even then $x$ and $y$ are odd.
\begin{quote}
Let's prove it by contrapositive. Contrapositive of the initial statement (which is equivalent to the initial statement) is:
\begin{center}
If $x$ is even or $y$ is even, then $xy - 1$ is odd.
\end{center}
If $x$ is even or $y$ is even, $xy$ is even. Then we can write that $xy = 2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then, $xy - 1 = 2k - 1 = 2(k - 1) + 1$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Now, let $t = l - 1$ where $l \in \mathbb{Z}$
and we get $xy - 1 = 2t + 1$. Thus, $xy - 1$ is odd.

\item[24.]
Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers whose mean is $m$ then at least one of\\
$x$ and $y$ is $\geq m$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x$ and $y$ are both $< m$.
Then by adding the inequalities, we get:
$$
x + y < 2m
$$
And finally,
$$
\dfrac{x + y}{2} < m
$$
which contradicts the initial statement that the mean of $x$ and $y$ is $m$.

\item[25.]
Suppose $S$ is a set of 250 distinct real numbers whose mean is 4. Must there exists
$x \in S$ such that $x > 4$? Be sure to prove your answer.
\begin{quote}
Yes. Let's prove it!\\
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all elements of $S$ are $\leq 4$.
Then the sum of all the elements will be less $\leq 1000$ with equality happening only
when all the members of the set are equal to $4$ which contradict the initial statement that
$S$ is a set of 250 \underline{distinct} elements. Thus, only one of the elements of $S$ is allowed
to be equal to 4. Finally, we get two cases:
\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]
All 250 elements of $S$ are less than 4.
\item[2.]
249 elements of $S$ are less than 4 and one is equal to 4.
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
If all 250 elements of $S$ are less than 4, then their sum is less than $4 \times 250 = 1000$ and their mean
is less than $1000 / 4 = 250$ which contradicts the initial statement that the mean of all elements of $S$ is 250.

If 249 elements of $S$ are less than 4 and one is equal to 4, then the sum of 249 elements which are less than 4 is less than
$249 \times 4 = 996$. Then let this sum of 249 numbers be equal to $996 - k$ where $k > 0$. Then the sum of all the elements including
the one which equals 4 is:
$$
996 - k + 4 = 1000 - k \mbox{ where } k > 0
$$
Using the fact above, we get that the mean of all the elements of $S$ is $(1000 - k)/250$ where $k > 0$.
And finally, we get:
$$
\dfrac{1000 - k}{250} = 4 - \dfrac{k}{250} \mbox{ where } k > 0
$$
And $4 - \dfrac{k}{250} \mbox{ where } k > 0$ is clearly less than 4 which contradicts
the initial claim that the mean of all elements of $S$ is 4.

\item[26.]
Suppose $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Prove that at least one of a and b is even.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that both $a$ and $b$ are odd.
Then, we can write $a = 2k - 1$ and $b = 2l - 1$ where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then, we have:
$$
a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 + 4l^2 - 4l + 1 = 4k^2 + 4l^2 - 4l - 4k + 2 = \\
$$
$$
= 2 \times (2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1)
$$

Now, it's easy to see that $a^2 + b^2$ is the multiplication of an even and odd
integers ($2$ is even and $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1$ is odd). $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1$ is
odd since $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1 = 2 \times (k^2 + l^2 - l - k) + 1$ and if we let $t = k^2 + l^2 - l - k$
where $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ (since $k^2 + l^2 - l - k \in \mathbb{Z}$), then we have that $2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1 = 2t + 1$
which is an even number plus one which is always odd. Finally, we conclude that $2$ is only once in the number that is supposed to be a perfect square as
$2k^2 + 2l^2 - 2l - 2k + 1$ is odd and is not a multiple of 2 which means
that $a^2 + b^2$ is not a perfect square which contradicts the initial claim that the sum
$a^2 + b^2$ is the perfect square.

\item[27.]
Prove that if $x,y \in \mathbb{R^+}$, then $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$.
\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x + y < 2\sqrt{xy}$.
Then, since $x,y \in \mathbb{R^+}$, we have:
\begin{align}
x + y < 2\sqrt{xy}\\
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy < 4xy\\
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy -4xy < 0\\
x^2 + y^2 - 2xy < 0\\
(x - y)^2 < 0
\end{align}
Thus, we got that $(x-y)^2 < 0$ which is false since the square of a number
is always $\geq 0$. Finally, since by assuming that $x + y < 2 \sqrt{xy} \mbox{ where } x, y\in \mathbb{R^+}$, we basically
got the nonsensical inequality $(x-y)^2 < 0$, something has to be wrong with this assumption and we got that
if $x,y \in \mathbb{R^+}$, then $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$

\item[28.]
Prove that if $n$ is an integer, there exist three consecutive integers that sum\\
to $n$ if and only if $n$ is a multiple of 3.
\begin{quote}
Let's first prove that if $n$ is not a multiple of 3, one cannot find
three consecutive integers with the property that they sum to $n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $n$ is not a multiple of 3.
Then let's define three consecutive integers, $m, m + 1$ and $m + 2$, where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then we have:
$$
m + m + 1 + m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3 \times (m + 1)
$$
Thus, we got that the sum of three consecutive integers is a multiple of 3
which contradicts the statement that $n$ is not a multiple of 3.
\end{itemize}
Now, lets prove the second half of the problem. Let's show that
if three consecutive integers sum to $n$, then $n$ is a multiple
of 3.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(b)]
Let $m, m+1, m+2$ where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ be three consecutive integers.
We have:
$$
n = m + m + 1 + m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3\times(m+1)
$$
Thus, we got that $n$ is a multiple of 3 which proves the iff.
\end{itemize}

\item[29.]
A subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ has the property that for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$
there exists $y \in S$ such that $|x - y| < 1$. Prove that $S$ is infinite.

\begin{quote}
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is finite.
Inequality, $|x - y| < 1$ can be transformed into the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
x - y < 1\\
x - y > -1
\end{cases}
$$
And from the system above, we get the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
y > x - 1\\
y < x + 1
\end{cases}
$$
Hence, we know that $y$ is in the open interval $(x-1, x+1)$.
Now, since we also know that $x \in \mathbb{R}$, interval $(x-1, x+1)$
has infinitely many elements in it which contradicts our assumption
that $S$ is finite.

\textit{Q.E.D.}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

\item[29.]
\begin{quote}
A subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is called \textbf{non-differential} if for every $x, y \in S$ we have
$x - y \notin S$. Here are some statements about non-differential sets. Decide which statements are
true and which are false, and provide a proof or counterexample for each as appropriate.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Every non-differential set is finite.
\begin{quote}
This is false. Counterexample:\\
Let $S = \{1,3,5,7,9,11...\}$ thus, $S$ is a set of all positive odd integers.
Then we know that for every $x, y$, $x - y$ is even. But all the members of $S$
are odd. Thus, For every $x,y \in S$, $x - y \notin S$ and $S$ is an infinite set
which also turns out to be non-differential and the initial statement is false.
\end{quote}
\item[(b)]
The intersection of two non-differential sets is non-differential.
\begin{quote}
This is true. Let's prove it.\\
Let $x, y \in A \cap B$. Then, since $x, y \in A$, $x - y \notin A$ as well as $x - y \notin A \cap B$. 
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D.}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}
\item[(c)]
The union of two non-differential sets is non-differential.
\begin{quote}
This is false. Counterexample:\\
Let $A = \{1, 3\}$ then $A$ is non-differential since $1 - 3  \notin A$
and $3 - 1 \notin A$. Now, let $B = \{1, 4\}$, then $B$ is non-differential too
as $1 - 4 \notin B$ and $4 - 1 \notin B$. Finally, we get $A \cup B = \{1, 3, 4\}$
which is \underline{NOT} non-differential because $4 - 3 = 1 \in A \cup B$.
\end{quote}
\item[(d)]
No non-differential set contains the element 0.
\begin{quote}
It's true.\\
For a set to be non-differential there should be no $x, y$ such that $x - y \in S$.
For the sake of contradiction, suppose that we have a non-differential set $A$ such that
$0 \in A$. If $A$ has more than one elements, let the other element (any element which is
not 0) be $k$. Then we get $k - 0 = k \in A$ which contradicts the initial statement that
$A$ is non-differential as we found two elements $x = 0$ and $y = k$ such that $x - y \in A$.
If $A$ has only one element which is $0$, then it is \underline{NOT} non-differential anyway,
because $0 - 0 = 0 \in A$. Hence, no non-differential set contains element 0.
\end{quote}
\item[(e)]
Every subset of a non-differential set is non-differential.
\begin{quote}
It's true.\\
Suppose we have two sets, $A$ and $B$ such that $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ is non-differential.
Let $x \in B$, then we know that there exists no $y$ in $A$ such that $x - y \in A$.
Since such $y$ does not exist in $A$, it does not exist in $B$ is as well since it is the subset
of $A$.
\begin{flushright}
\textit{Q.E.D.}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}
\item[(f)]
There is no non-differential set with exactly 5 elements.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample:\\
Let $A = \{1, 3, 8, 19, 50\}$, then we have:
\begin{center}
$1 - 3 = -2 \notin A$\\
$3 - 1 = 2 \notin A$\\
$3 - 8 = -5 \notin A$\\
$8 - 3 = 5 \notin A$\\
$8 - 19 = -11 \notin A$\\
$19 - 8 = 11 \notin A$\\
$19 - 50 = -31 \notin A$\\
$50 - 19 = 31 \notin A$\\
\end{center}
\end{quote}
\item[(g)]
If $S$ is non-differential, so is $\mathbb{Z} - S$.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample:\\
Let $A = \{1, 3\}$. $A$ is non-differential since $1 - 3 = -2 \notin A$ and $3 - 1 = 2 \notin A$.
Then we know that $Z - A$ would include numbers $7,8,15$. But $15 - 8 = 7 \in Z - A$ which is not
non-differential.
\end{quote}
\item[(h)]
If $S$ is a non-differential set, then so is the $S_{+3} = \{x + 3 \ | \ x \in S\}$.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample:\\
Let $A = \{1, 3, 8, 19, 50\}$, then $A$ is non-differential since:
\begin{center}
$1 - 3 = -2 \notin A$\\
$3 - 1 = 2 \notin A$\\
$3 - 8 = -5 \notin A$\\
$8 - 3 = 5 \notin A$\\
$8 - 19 = -11 \notin A$\\
$19 - 8 = 11 \notin A$\\
$19 - 50 = -31 \notin A$\\
$50 - 19 = 31 \notin A$\\
\end{center}
$A_{+3} = \{1, 4, 11, 22, 54\}$. Now, notice that $22 - 11 = 11 \in A_{+3}$ thus, we found
two elements $x = 22$ and $y = 11$ such that $x - y \in A$ and so $A$ is \underline{NOT} non-differential.
Thus, the initial statement is false.
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
\item[30]
A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is called \textbf{cofinite} if $\mathbb{R} - A$ is finite. Here are some statements about
cofinite sets. Decide which statements are true and which are false, and provide a proof
or counterexample for each as appropriate
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
If $A \subseteq B$ and $B$ is cofinite then $A$ is cofinite.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Counterexample:\\
Let $B = \mathbb{R} - \{0, 1\}$. Then $B$ is cofinite as $\mathbb{R} - B = \{0, 1\}$.
Now let $A = \{-1, -2\}$, then $A \subseteq B$, however, $\mathbb{R} - A$ is not finite
as $R$ has an infinite number of elements and subtracting only a finite number of elements
(2 elements) still leaves it will infinitely many.
\end{quote}
\item[(b)]
There exist two cofinite sets $A$ and $B$ with the property that\\
$A \cap B = \emptyset$.
\begin{quote}
It's false. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $A$ and $B$ are cofinite
sets. Then we know that both $A$ and $B$ are of the form $\mathbb{R} - F$ where $F$
is some finite set. Let $A = \mathbb{R} - C$ and $B = \mathbb{R} - D$. Then we know that
both $A$ and $B$ contain sets $\mathbb{R} - C - D$. Thus $\mathbb{R} - C - D \subseteq A \cap B$
which is never an $\emptyset$ since sets $C$ and $D$ are finite and $\mathbb{R} - C - D$ is infinite.\\
\end{quote}
\item[(c)]
If $A$ is cofinite, then $A$ contains a positive integer.
\begin{quote}
It's true.\\
We know that $\mathbb{R}$ contains all the positive integers. For $A$
to be cofinite it $\mathbb{R} - A$ should be finite thus, it should
have a finite number of elements. If $A$ has no positive integers,
it means that $\mathbb{R} - A$ is infinite since it contain
at least all the positive integers. Thus, $A$ is not cofinite and
we've encountered a contradiction. And finally, the statement if
$A$ is cofinite, then $A$ contains a positive integer is true.
\end{quote}
\item[(d)]
The intersection of two cofinite sets is cofinite.
