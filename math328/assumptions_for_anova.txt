Assumptions for ANOVA
To use the ANOVA test we made the following assumptions:

* Each group sample is drawn from a normally distributed population
* All populations have a common variance
* All samples are drawn independently of each other
* Within each sample, the observations are sampled randomly and independently
  of each other
* Factor effects are additive

The presence of outliers can also cause problems. In addition, we need to make
sure that the F statistic is well behaved. In particular, the F statistic is
relatively robust to violations of normality provided:

* The populations are symmetrical and uni-modal.
* The sample sizes for the groups are equal and greater than 10

In general, as long as the sample sizes are equal (called a balanced model) and
sufficiently large, the normality assumption can be violated provided the
samples are symmetrical or at least similar in shape (e.g. all are negatively
skewed).

The F statistic is not so robust to violations of homogeneity of variances. A
rule of thumb for balnced models is that if the ratio of the largest variance
to smallest variance is less than 3 or 4, the F-test will be valid. If the
sample sizes are unequal then smaller differences in variances can invalidate
the F-test. Much more attention needs to be paid to unequal variances than to
non-normality of data.

We now look at how to test for violations of these assumptions and how to deal
with any violations when they occur.

* Testing that the population is normally distributed (see Testing for
  Normality and Symmetry)
* Testing for homogeneity of variances and dealing with violations (see
  Homogeneity of Variances)
* Testing for and dealing with outliers (see Outliers in ANOVA)
