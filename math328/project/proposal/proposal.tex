\subsection*{\centering\color{orange}{Color Effects on Perceived Quality of
Online Shopping Web Page}}

We propose to analyze the color online shopping dataset~\cite{1}. The dataset
is suitable for a 3-factor experiment of online shopping. It contains three
categorical factors: web page hue (1 = Blue, 2 = Red), Brightness (1 = Dark, 2
= Bright), and Price (1 = Low, 2 = high). Sample sizes are unbalanced.
\\\\
The variable breakdown is shown below:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{r}
        Variable names:
            quality  # Percieved quality
            trt_id   # ID
            hue      # Hue
            bright   # Brightness
            price    # Price
            X_hue    # Effect coding: Blue=1, Red=-1
            X_bright #                Dark=1, Bright=-1
            X_price  #                Low=1, High=-1
    \end{minted}
\end{figure}

Among the listed variables, it is likely that variables \mintinline{r}{trt_id},
\mintinline{r}{X_hue}, \mintinline{r}{X_bright}, and \mintinline{r}{X_price}
are not going to be used (might be dropped). Hence, we will only use the
variables \mintinline{r}{quality} (as a response), \mintinline{r}{hue},
\mintinline{r}{bright}, and \mintinline{r}{price}. The analysis will follow the
steps presented in Dr.~Phil's ``Math 328 Project Analysis and Report
Checklist.~\cite{2}''
