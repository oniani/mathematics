## Exercise 6.36

```{r}
data("Alfalfa")

# (a)
df4 = Alfalfa$Ht4
mean_df4 = mean(df4)
sd_df4 = sd(df4)

print(mean_df4)
print(sd_df4)

lr = lm(Ht4 ~ Acid + Row, Alfalfa)
summary(lr)

# (b)
# ANOVA
s = summary(aov(Ht4 ~ Acid + Row, data=Alfalfa))
print(s)

# (c)
# Residual analysis
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(lr, which = 1:2)
# Reset
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

(a) The average for the growth in all 15 cups is 1.74 and the standard deviation
    for the growth in all 15 cups is approximately 1.11.
(b) Performed the ANOVA (see the code above).
(c) We can see that the acids are all independent of each other and thus,
    the condition for independence holds. From Residuals vs Fitted plot, we
    see that the red line is does not necessarily align with the black
    dotted line and is not flat. This means that there is some non-linear
    trend to the residuals. In the Normal QQ plot, we see that there are
    some data points that deviates form the dotted line. Hence, not all
    ANOVA conditions are met.
(d) Based on the ANOVA table, we can conclude that there is a significant
    difference in average growth due to the treatments. This is the case
    since the p-value is significant (0.0487 < 0.05).
(e) Based on the ANOVA table, we cannot conclude that there is a significant
    difference in average growth due to the distance from the window. This
    is the case since the p-value is not significant (0.3235 > 0.05).
