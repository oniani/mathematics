Definitions:

Experimental units are the people, animals, dishes, or other things that you
assign to groups and record responses for.

The explanatory factor is the set of categories or conditions that determine
the groups.

The levels are the different groups: each unit is assigned one level of the
explanatory factor. For a one-way ANOVA, we use the term treatment
interchangeably with level, although these have different meanings when more
than one factor is used.

An experimental design is balanced if each level of the explanatory factor is
assigned to the same number of units.

The response variable is whatever is measured about each unit after the
treatment has been applied.
